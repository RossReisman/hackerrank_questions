Designer Door Mat

Mr. Vincent works in a door mat manufacturing company. One day, he designed a new door mat with the following specifications:

Mat size must be N X M. N ( is an odd natural number, and M is 3 times N.)
The design should have 'WELCOME' written in the center.
The design pattern should only use |, . and - characters.

First Attempt

dash = '-'
dot = '.'
bar = '|'
comma = ','

def create_mat(length, width)
    for i in range(length):
        print((dash*i).center(length-1))
    for j in range(width):
        print((dot*j).center(width-1))

Solution

n, m = map(int, input().split())
for i in range(1, n, 2):
    print((i * '.|.').center(m, '-'))
print('WELCOME'.center(m, '-'))
for i in range(n-2, -1, -2):
    print((i * '.|.').center(m, '-'))
