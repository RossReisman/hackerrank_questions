Mr. Anant Asankhya is the manager at the INFINITE hotel. The hotel has an
infinite amount of rooms.

One fine day, a finite number of tourists come to stay at the hotel.
The tourists consist of:
→ A Captain.
→ An unknown group of families consisting of K members per group where K ≠ 1.

The Captain was given a separate room, and the rest were given one room per
group.

Mr. Anant has an unordered list of randomly arranged room entries. The list
consists of the room numbers for all of the tourists. The room numbers will
appear K times per group except for the Captain's room.

Mr. Anant needs you to help him find the Captain's room number.
The total number of tourists or the total number of groups of families is not known to you.
You only know the value of K and the room number list.

Input Format

The first line consists of an integer, K, the size of each group.
The second line contains the unordered elements of the room number list.


Constraints

1 < K < 1000

Output Format

Output the Captain's room number.

Sample Input

5
1 2 3 6 5 4 4 2 5 3 6 1 6 5 3 2 4 1 2 5 1 4 3 6 8 4 3 1 5 6 2
Sample Output

8

group_size = int(input())
room_num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in room_num_list:
    # count the number of appearances and choose the lowest one
    if room_num_list[i] < group_size:
        print(room_num_list[i])


# Second Attempt:

import pandas as pd

group_size = int(input())
room_num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))

counts = pd.Series(room_num_list).value_counts()
print(counts)

# Couldnt get pandas to import in Hackerrank

# Third Attempt:

group_size = int(input())
room_num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in room_num_list:
    count1 = room_num_list.count(1)
    count2 = room_num_list.count(2)
    count3 = room_num_list.count(3)
    count4 = room_num_list.count(4)
    count5 = room_num_list.count(5)
    count6 = room_num_list.count(6)
    count7 = room_num_list.count(7)
    count8 = room_num_list.count(8)

    #if room_num_list[i] < group_size:
    print(count1, count2, count3, count4, count5, count6, count7, count8)

# From this we can see that 8 is the only room with 1 member therefore
# it must be the captain's room

# Solution:

from collections import Counter

n = int(input())
rooms = [int(x) for x in input().split()
cnt = Counter(rooms)

for k, v in cnt.items():
    if v == 1:
        print(k)
        break
